## Introduction
Content Security Policy(CSP) is additional layer of protection to detect and remediate attack like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and injection attacks. Since XSS being commonly found vulnerability and it is always preferred to patched by code level. However, having effective and efficient CSP in place can give a breather for DevSecOps of an organization.

The main purpose of this tool is to provide list of domains whose CSP is changed from last time.

## Requirements
pip3 install validators

## Features
- Check for presence of CSP on input domain
- Calculate the CSP checksum [Next release]
- Check for change in CSP from last time [Next release]
